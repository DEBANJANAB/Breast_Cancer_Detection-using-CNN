# Breast_Cancer_Detection-using-CNN


The goal of this project is to create a web based tool that can batch analyze histopathology image patches and predict if breast cancer is present. The web app will be able to detect two forms of breast cancer:

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)


Metastatic Cancer

We will create two CNN models, an IDC_model and a Metastatic_model. These models will be loaded into a Tensorflowjs web app.
